## What is Caveman Linux?

At its base, Caveman Linux is an Arch Linux-based Linux operating system aimed and providing a quality experience to its users.
Above that, however, Caveman Linux hopes to be a tunnel for new users into the metaphorical ecosystem of Linux
The Caveman Project uses GNOME as its desktop manager, a highly customizeable DE capable of hosting a multitude of users from new
to veteran experience in the world of Linux

## Why Caveman?

# Main Features: 
- GNOME with our improvements!
- Insanely fast package management!
- An extremely reliable AUR helper 
- Stable!
- based on Arch Linux
- designed for beginners to Linux
- simple user interface design

# Why Arch?
we believe that Arch Linux is a amazing and stable operating system, and also that a rolling release system is superior to a point release system.
This is because newer software can reach users faster. By building our project on Arch Linux, a versatile and amazing distro,
we can provide breaking edge software alongside incredible stability and usability

# Isnt Arch too Advanced?
There is a stigma against usage of the Arch Linux distribution when it comes to beginners, many claim it is too unstable
and too difficult to understand as a new Linux user. But we hope to change that. We believe that Arch Linux is a very powerful distro.
Our goal as the Caveman Dev Team is to bring such a powerful distro to beginners by giving Arch "Training Wheels"
Such modifications could show to the average Linuxer that Arch does excel as a general use distro
