## okay, but why base it off Arch Linux?
we believe that Arch Linux is a amazing and stable operating system, and also that a rolling release system is superior to a point release system because newer software can reach users faster. By building our project on Arch Linux, a versatile and amazing distro, we can provide breaking edge software alongside incredible stability and usability

## isn't Arch Linux meant to be for "advanced users"?
We believe that Arch Linux is a very powerful distro. Our goal as the Caveman Dev Team is to bring such a powerful distro to beginners by giving Arch "Training Wheels" Such modifications could show to the average Linuxer that Arch does excel as a general use distro
