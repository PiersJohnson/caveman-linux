## okay, but why base it off Arch Linux?
we believe that Arch Linux is a amazing and stable operating system, and we believe that a rolling release system is very good because it provides newer software. by basing our project on Arch Linux, we get all of these benefits, but with our own modifications.

## isn't Arch Linux meant to be for "advanced users"?
most people say that, however, we've added multiple features to make sure that beginners won't have to worry about certain issues. imagine this as a version of Arch Linux, but already built for you!
