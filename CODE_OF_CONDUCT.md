# Caveman Linux Code of Conduct
### Last Updated: 2023-07-17

## Doing Our Part
As Open Source maintainers, contributors, and fans, we believe that you should be able to develop without any borders. We value diversity and inclusion, and we encourage EVERYONE to participate. We strive to provide a space where you are welcome, regardless of:

-   age
-   body size
-   caste
-   citizenship
-   disability
-   education
-   ethnicity
-   familial status
-   gender expression
-   gender identity
-   genetic information
-   immigration status
-   level of experience
-   nationality
-   personal appearance
-   pregnancy
-   race
-   religion
-   sex characteristics
-   sexual orientation
-   sexual identity
-   socio-economic status
-   tribe
-   veteran status

Open Source software is the way we work. We believe that when everyone works together, we can develop the future. That's why we promise that we will interact and behave in ways that are beneficial to our community. Following these guidelines ensure that everyone is able to participate without fear of discrimination. These guidelines apply everywhere. 

## Expected Behavior
In a place where everyone works together, conflicts are expected. That's why we ask that you do the following.

1. **Be friendly**
	- We ask that you not be disrespectful for beginners or contributors, and that you use welcoming and inclusive language. We also ask that you respect peoples chosen names and pronouns.

2. **Be understanding**
	- While reading other users contributions, we ask that you be understanding. This means that you will try your best to view the user's submission in their point of view.

3.  **Be considerate**
	- While you might have your opinions, we ask that you consider the other suggestion, and we ask that you be kind while doing so.

## What's not allowed

During Caveman Linux development, we strive to create a diverse experience. To achieve this, we've provided a few examples of things that are NOT allowed.

1. **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, and leaking personal information**
	- We ask that you do NOT intimidate, stalk, or follow community members. You may NOT use certain technologies, look through commit histories (with the intent to stalk), or track people online. We also ask that you do NOT leak personally identifiable information of community members online.

2. **Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist language or otherwise exclusionary language.**
	- This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, deadnaming, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual's gender identity. This also includes making exclusionary "jokes". If you're unsure if a word is derogatory, don't use it. Also, we ask that you do NOT look through commit histories with the intent to search for deadnames.

3. **Unwelcome sexual attention or behavior that contributes to a sexualized environment.**
	- We try to keep a pretty clean environment. While the usual swear word here and there is allowed (as long as it not directed to anyone), we ask that you do not introduce certain things that contributes to a sexualized environment. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications, presentation materials, and social media posts related to Caveman Software. 

4. **Violence or threats of violence.**
	- We ask that you do NOT do acts of violence or do threats of violence. This activity is NOT tolerated offline, online, and on official Caveman Software boards. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm activities.

5. **Influencing or encouraging inappropriate behavior.** If you influence or encourage another person to violate the Code of Conduct, you may face the same consequences as if you had violated the Code of Conduct.

## Consequences

The Caveman Developer Board will serve consequences based on the weight and severity of the violation. The following consequences might happen:

- Blocked from making commits
- Banned from community interaction
- Blacklisted from Caveman Software events, or other Caveman Software related projects
- Warnings issued to the rule breaker 

## Reporting Incidents
You may report violations by sending an email to this address, or messaging a member of the Caveman Software Board.
